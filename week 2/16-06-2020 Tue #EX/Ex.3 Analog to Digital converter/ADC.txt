Arduino can deal with  maximum i/p voltage = 5V
Arduino boards contain a multichannel, 10-bit analog to digital converter.
Where, the maximum resolution = 10 bit we can converte this number 
to more readable value by conversion from binary system to decimal number 
10 bit = 1024 
therefor arduino can handle analog signal as integr values from 0 - 1024 
now by dividing 5 volt / 1024 = 4.9mV
we get the resolution of analog reading per unit (4.9mV/Unit)
